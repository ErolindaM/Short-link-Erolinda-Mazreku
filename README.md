This project is a demo Shortlink generator built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to showcase how localStorage can be used to store and manage data in the browser. Users can enter a username to create a shortened link representation, set an expiration time, and delete stored URLs whenever they want. 

Note that the links are not real redirects but simply simulate the shortening process for learning and demonstration purposes.
